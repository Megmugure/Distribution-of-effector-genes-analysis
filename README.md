# Distribution-of-effector-genes-analysis

A total of 178 effector genes (both virulent and avirulent) from M. oryzae isolates that infect a variety of hosts; rice, wheat, oat, millet, and wild grasses are used for this analysis. These genes were obtained from Latorre et al., (2020).

The goal is to explore the presence/absence patterns of distribution of the effector genes across the isolates from Africa and a few from outside Africa.
